Library Management System
This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in C++. It allows librarians to manage book records and students to register, issue, and return books. The system uses a binary search tree (BST) for storing book information and file I/O for persisting data.

Data Persistence
Students: Student data (name, ID, stream, issued books) is saved to and loaded from students.txt.
Books: Book data (name, total quantity, available quantity) is saved to and loaded from books.txt.

File I/O
Students: The students' information is saved to a text file (students.txt) and loaded when the program starts.
Books: The books' information is saved to a text file (books.txt) and loaded when the program starts.

Binary Search Tree (BST)
The BST is used to store book records, ensuring efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
